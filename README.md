# Deploying with Terraform

You can get your Heroku API key from the Heroku dashboard

```
export HEROKU_API_KEY=
export HEROKU_EMAIL=
```

For AWS, create an IAM user with Administrator rights

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

Open `.env` and set `TF_VAR_project_name=projectname`
Edit `terraform.tf`
```
# Store Terraform state in S3 (this must be prepared in advance)
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "projectname"
    key = "wp/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-1"
  }
}

# AWS security group for public database access
resource "aws_security_group" "projectname" {
  name = "projectname"
  description = "public RDS security group"
  ingress {
    from_port = 3306
    to_port = 3306
    protocol = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  egress {
    from_port = 0
    to_port = 0
    protocol = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```


The state of Terraform is managed in S3, so it should automatically sync any changes from the remote backend. For this you'll need to manually set up an S3 bucket in the eu-west-1 region with the name wp-terraform-backend

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```
